lazy video controller which uses my webcam feed to detect hand gestures in real time and based on the number of fingers raised stimulates specific keyboard keys using python libraries. 

lazyvideocontroller is a hand gesture recognition system that uses your webcam feed to detect hand gestures in real-time. Based on the number of fingers raised, the system simulates specific keyboard actions, like arrow keys or the spacebar, using Python libraries. This project utilizes machine learning and computer vision to make gesture-based interaction possible with minimal setup.
